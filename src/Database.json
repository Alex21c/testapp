      "description": ["Boondi Raita is a popular Indian side dish made with yogurt (curd) and boondi, which are small, deep-fried chickpea flour balls. To prepare Boondi Raita, plain yogurt is whipped until smooth and creamy. Then, salt, roasted cumin powder, chaat masala, and sometimes black salt are added to the yogurt to enhance its flavor.",
      
      "Next, the crispy boondi is soaked in water briefly to remove excess oil and to soften slightly. The soaked boondi is then squeezed gently to remove excess water before being added to the seasoned yogurt. The boondi adds a crunchy texture to the creamy yogurt, creating a delightful contrast.",
      
      "Boondi Raita is often garnished with chopped cilantro (coriander) leaves and sometimes a sprinkle of red chili powder or paprika for color and added flavor. It is served chilled as a refreshing accompaniment to spicy Indian dishes like biryani, pulao, or kebabs. The cool and tangy flavor of the raita helps balance the heat and richness of the main dish, making it a popular choice in Indian cuisine."]
